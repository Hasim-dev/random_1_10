SSL offloading performance of a load balancer can be monitored with tools like Zabbix, Grafana etc.

Below metrics can be monitored for various insights to gain about the load balancer.

1.	Active connections
2.	Failed connections
3.	Total number of requests
4.	Latency 
5.	Number of healthy and unhealthy hosts
6.	Throughput
7.	Response time

1.	Active connection
Represents the number of active connections between the client and the servers. Load distribution among cluster members can be monitored to understand whether or not it is evenly distributed.
2.	Failed connections
Represents the number of failed connections between the client and the servers. This metrics can be used to see if the servers fail to establish connections. Uneven numbers of failures may indicate issues with individual servers.
3.	Total number of requests
Total number of requests that a load balancer is handling might be correlated with increasing traffic, latency, network or routing issues.
4.	Latency 
Latency is the time it takes for a connection request to be completed and return to user. It is directly tied to the user experience so it is important to keep an eye on.
5.	Number of healthy and unhealthy hosts
Number of healthy hosts in the cluster is important to prevent a service outage and plan a proactive maintenance.
6.	Throughput 
Throughput is the measurement of successfully completed requests. It provides an insight about the efficiency of the load balancer. 
7.	Response time
Response time is the time it takes for the load balancer to send the request to a target 
until the target started to send the response back. Response time can be monitored to gain insight about the health of servers handling the requests. Slow processing of requests can increase the queue length thus could increase the load on other servers.
